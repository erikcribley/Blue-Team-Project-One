# NY Times Read This

This app uses ajax to retrieve data from the New York Times Best Seller List API.  

The top 15 books are displayed by cover photo, title, authors name, publisher, brief description, previous spot on list, and length of weeks listed.

The data is retrieved through a simple ajax get request. A for loop iterates through the JSON response and displays all the above for each of the 15 books currently on the best seller list.

The data is displayed through jQuery.

The books are updated dynamically and are always up to date.

Currently the app only displays the hardcover fiction list, but soon a drop down menu will be added allowing the user to cycle to different categories
